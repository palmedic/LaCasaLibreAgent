# Home Assistant Light Wrappers

# Add this to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml file:

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Copy the light: section above to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml
#
# 2. Or create a separate file (e.g., lights.yaml) and include it:
#    # In configuration.yaml:
#    light: !include lights.yaml
#
# 3. Check your configuration:
#    - Go to Developer Tools → YAML
#    - Click "Check Configuration"
#    - Fix any errors if they appear
#
# 4. Restart Home Assistant:
#    - Go to Developer Tools → YAML
#    - Click "Restart" under "Server management"
#    - Wait for restart to complete
#
# 5. Verify the new light entities:
#    - Go to Developer Tools → States
#    - Filter by "light."
#    - You should see all new light.* entities
#
# RESULT:
# After this configuration, you'll have:
#   - light.kitchen_ceiling_light (controls switch.kitchen)
#   - light.dining_room_light (controls switch.dinning_light)
#   - light.kamma_light (controls switch.kamma_light)
#   - light.master_bedroom_light (controls switch.master_bedroom)
#   - light.master_bathroom_light (controls switch.master_bathroom)
#   - light.kids_bathroom_light (controls switch.kids_bath)
#   - light.home_office_light (controls switch.work_room)
#   - light.entrance_light (controls switch.entrance)
#   - light.hallway_light (controls switch.hallway)
#   - light.porch_1_light (controls switch.porch_1)
#   - light.porch_2_light (controls switch.porch_2)
#   - light.porch_main_light (controls switch.porch_light)
#
# These will all show up in the "light" domain and work with commands like:
#   - "Turn on the kitchen light"
#   - "Turn off all lights"
#   - "What lights are on?"
